                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span>NAPLES</span> &ndash; The charms of John and Mary Anne McAvoy McKerrow go a long way toward lifting the slight material of
                        "I Do! I Do!" from interesting to outstanding. The duo, married in real life, sing, dance, dip, spin and bounce across the wide
                        Sugden stage and &ndash; in the end &ndash; produce a solid night of entertainment out of a show that's probably beneath their
                        talents.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Based on a 1951 play "The Fourposter" by Jan de Hartog, "I Do! I Do!" covers 50 years in the life of Michael (John McKerrow) and
                        Agnes (Mary Anne McAvoy McKerrow. Book and lyrics come from Tom Jones, with music by Harvey Schmidt.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "I Do! I Do!" premiered on Broadway in 1966 and serves up an old&ndash;fashioned view of marriage that modern audiences might
                        find either quaint or mildly offensive. Michael comes off a cad and the show's one hint that Agnes might entertain a life outside
                        marriage ends with her distracted by a shiny new bracelet. The show's generic marital back-and-forth remains relatable &ndash;
                        but modern&ndash;day partnerships encompass so much more - and the lack thereof can't help leaving "I Do! I Do!" feeling dated.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With just two actors, both McKerrows have plenty of opportunities - comic and vocal - to shine, although the first half doesn't
                        truly get untracked until a hysterical "she's having a baby" segment. Then, just wait until Mary Anne McAvoy McKerrow pedals
                        around the stage on a tricycle or belts out "Flaming Agnes" wearing a hat that some poor pigeon died to provide the feathers for.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        John McKerrow sings for every father in the audience during "Father of the Bride" and displays a deft touch with the comic parts.
                        Duets - including the signature "My Cup Runneth Over" and the lovely "Where Are The Snows?" speak to love, life, marriage and
                        family.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Director and choreographer Dawn Lebrecht Fornara uses every inch of the stage - built on at least three levels to make the stage
                        feel more intimate - four if you count the bed; there's movement aplenty for a two-person show - and both McKerrows have all the
                        right moves. Watch for John McKerrow's nifty tricks with a cane and Mary Anne McAvoy McKerrow's rambunctious flouncing with a
                        Spanish shawl.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In keeping with the traditionalist theme, Mike Santos elects somber greens, golds and browns for the massive bedroom set, with
                        splashes of color coming via costumes and the soft furnishings. Dot Auchmoody and Rick Foreman's costumes pop out of the
                        background - especially Mary Anne McAvoy McKerrow's vivid royal blue party dress. Music comes from two pianos hidden behind an
                        enormous golden window and tinkled with panache by Charles Fornara and Robin Schuford Frank.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Issues with the show's relevance to modern life aside, "I Do! I Do!" serves up a charming buffet of fancy footwook, bouncing on
                        the bed fun, stumbling up the stair silliness, marriage as a journey that anyone who's every walked down the aisle will
                        appreciate. What "I Do! I Do!" has to say isn't anything original, but the actors - and the audience - have a lot of fun on the
                        journey.

                        at the
                        season&rsquo;s opening show on stage the Sugden Community Theatre through h T Oct. 30. The show by Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt
                        combines an intimate set and a cast of two to tell the tuneful story of a 50-year marriage, from their blissful wedding day into
                        their bittersweet golden years. Playing the roles of Michael and Agnes Snow are a couple of veteran actors whose chemistry is so
                        vivid that playgoers might wonder if they really are married. In fact, they are. Mr. and Mrs. for 18 years, John and Mary Anne
                        McKerrow cKerrow are thrilled to take on &ldquo;I Do! I Do!&rdquo; and are appropriately paired with husband-and-wife directing team Dawn
                        Lebrecht Fornara and Charles Fornara. The foursome is out to prove that marriage requires hard work, but that the strength of a
                        happy union is a force to be reckoned with.

                    <p>
                        <strong>&gt;&gt; FW:</strong> Does being married make it easier or more of a challenge to play your roles in &ldquo;I Do! I Do!&rdquo;? You
                        obviously have a very definite concept of a married relationship, being that you are in one together every day. Is it difficult
                        to stray from the concepts you already have in order to portray Michael and Agnes?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>&gt;&gt; Mary Anne:</strong> We actually won&rsquo;t have to deviate much. The characters? development is really at the
                        discretion of the actors, for this show. For the most part, Michael and Agnes lend themselves easily to our own experiences as a
                        couple. We do have to invent somewhat, however. We&rsquo;ve been married 18 years, which means that about three-fifths of the
                        experiences Michael and Agnes have had, we haven&rsquo;t.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <img alt=""
                        id="rt-img-04" height="250" src="mckerrows/images/dancing.jpg" title="" width="152" />> 
                        <strong>&gt;&gt;John:</strong> We haven&rsquo;t grown old together and we don&rsquo;t have any children.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>&gt;&gt; Mary Anne:</strong> We&rsquo;ve never &ldquo;spawned&rdquo; (laughs)? but our young niece Amber lives with us, so that helps. It?s
                        given us some &ldquo;parenting&rdquo; experience to draw from. I haven&rsquo;t had some of the feelings that come with a long-term commitment like
                        the one Michael and Agnes have. I haven&rsquo;t woken up one morning and realized, &ldquo;Oh, my God. I&rsquo;ve been someone&rsquo;s wife for 40 years.
                        What am I doing with my life&rdquo;? I don?t feel like that.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>&gt;&gt; FW:</strong> Have you ever played husband and wife before?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>&gt;&gt; John:</strong> No. Although we?ve been in many shows together, we?ve never played a couple and we?ve only played
                        opposite one another one other time (in &rdquo;Little Shop of Horrors,&ldquo; as Audrey and Seymour).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>&gt;&gt; Mary Anne:</strong> Last summer, I played his stepmother in &ldquo;Thoroughly Modern Millie&rdquo;.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>&gt;&gt; FW:</strong> So are the Snows really all that different from yourselves?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>&gt;&gt; John:</strong> No.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>&gt;&gt; Mary Anne:</strong> I can totally see myself calling him a &ldquo;pompous ass&rdquo; ? like Agnes does to Michael! But at
                        some point in the show, I stop being Mary Anne. Obviously, when I get to experiences that I haven?t had yet, I have to start
                        creating. And I?ll definitely cry. I?ll cry every night? At one point, Agnes goes through a box of old photos and realizes the
                        disparity between the parts of her life depicted and her current stage in life. It?s very moving.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>&gt;&gt; John:</strong> It&rsquo;s something everyone can relate to, married or not. It&rsquo;s a universal human experience,
                        observing the passage of time. We pull from our own experiences and use them to predict what it would be like to be &ldquo;John and
                        Mary Anne&rdquo; as &ldquo;Agnes and Michael&rdquo; moving through 30, 40 and 50 years of marriage.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>&gt;&gt; FW:</strong> The concept of marriage as portrayed in the show is said to be a bit archaic. Do you think so? Are
                        there still some of these traditional elements alive, or is the show more like a snapshot of an older time? Have things changed
                        all that much?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>&gt;&gt; Mary Anne:</strong> Most of the show&rsquo;s points are extremely relevant, but certain elements do date it (to the
                        turn of the century). Like the song &ldquo;Flaming Agnes&rdquo;, where Agnes asserts her independence and strength as a woman by wearing a
                        gaudy hat. That&rsquo;s not so much of a statement these days. But it works.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>&gt;&gt; John:</strong> Many of our audiences will consist of couples and individuals who were married in the time of
                        Michael and Agnes, and so for them it will be easy to relate. For everyone, though, the show highlights the things about the
                        union of marriage that haven&rsquo;t changed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>&gt;&gt; FW:</strong> Michael and Agnes seem to depend on a sense of humor to get them through the ups and downs of
                        marriage. Do you? Have you had any specific moments like those in the lives of Agnes and Michael that you pull from to create
                        your characters?

                        <strong>&gt;&gt; Mary Anne:</strong> Oh, yes, definitely! You have to laugh. I&rsquo;m a laugher? but I wouldn&rsquo;t wear cold cream to
                        bed, like Agnes. I would wear make-up, though. When we lived in New York, I used to wear make-up to bed because we lived on the
                        sixth floor and no firefighter would climb up to the sixth floor to rescue an unmade up person! It&rsquo;s a fact. It&rsquo;s been sort of
                        an ongoing joke between us.

                        <strong>&gt;&gt; Mary Anne:</strong> Sure you would! Yes, we like to laugh.

                        <strong>&gt;&gt; John:</strong> Michael finds it comical to carry his wife around, too. As he creeps up to very advanced years,
                        he still insists on carrying Agnes around. He carries her over the threshold as they leave their bedroom for the last time. It&rsquo;s
                        meant to be comical of course, that will only work if he&rsquo;s REALLY old!
