                <p class="ortiz-text">
                    Darwin Ortiz makes his living with a deck of cards. As an entertainer and expert consultant he has performed on every continent
                    except Antarctica.
                </p>

                <p class="ortiz-text">
                    At an age when other children were learning to play marbles, Darwin was learning how to manipulate a deck from the card
                    "mechanics" in his South Bronx neighborhood. Eventually, he left New York University Law School to pursue his interest full time.
                </p>

                <p class="ortiz-text">
                    Darwin practices religiously six hours a day, wearing out over five hundred decks of cards each year. Through his dedication, he
                    has brought the art of sleight of hand to a new level of perfection. Many of the techniques he employs in his performances have
                    never been duplicated.

                <p class="ortiz-text">
                    Darwin's book <b>Gambling Scams</b> has been widely hailed as the definitive work on crooked gambling methods; it is presently
                    being used as a reference and training tool by casinos in a dozen countries.

                    Despite his skill at card manipulation, as a gambler, Darwin relied on his head rather than his hands. He belongs to MENSA (the
                    high IQ organization) and has a photographic memory and a mathematical aptitude among the top 1% - qualities which made him a
                    highly successful blackjack player until he was barred by all the major casinos.
