                Simultaneously intelligent and wacky, Billy Bob Steinberg&rsquo;s stage show draws on his background in stand-up and musical comedy,
                theatre, circus arts, and magic.&nbsp; His spontaneity, unique imagination, and showmanship create a full&ndash;speed&ndash;ahead act
                that leaves people laughing uncontrollably.&nbsp; Using a variety of hysterical props and a banjo &mdash; his act is &ldquo;total
                off&ndash;the&ndash;wall, roll&ndash;in&ndash;the&ndash;aisles, spill&ndash;your drink fun!" &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll laugh so hard your

                In a nutshell...

                I was born in New York City,&nbsp; my family from Brooklyn, with roots in Cripple Creek, Colorado (NO WAY, really?).&nbsp; I began to
                perform magic as a youngster, and soon learned to juggle. My defining moment was witnessing my hero, STEVE MARTIN, for the first
                time!&nbsp; He was the GREATEST, FUNNIEST, MOST AMAZING PERFORMER I&rsquo;VE EVER SEEN... Steve performed magic...., I performed
                magic. Steve juggled...., I juggled.Steve was funny...., I thought I was funny. All I knew, I wanted to be just like him.&nbsp; So,
                first things first, sold my prize hog and bought a used banjo (yup, it was pp&rsquo;d.... previously picked).
            </p>

            <p>
                In my teens, I was given an opportunity to perform with Clyde Beatty-Cole Brothers Circus, the World&rsquo;s Largest Tent Circus. It
                was an incredible experience, and it was SO MUCH FUN!!!
            </p>

            <p>
                That led to jobs performing for people like Andy Warhol, John Lennon &amp; Mick Jagger, which led to more work with some awesome rock
                bands such as Deep Purple and Van Halen Hey, I even appeared in Rolling Stone Magazine with Phil Collins!
            </p>

            <p>
                After graduating college with a degree in music, I began to street perform, and acting in Off Broadway Theater. Soon, I started
                warming up audiences for TV shows, and opening up for some top headliners. Over the years I&rsquo;ve appeared with a virtual
                who&rsquo;s who of music &amp; comedy, performing in the top theaters &amp; venues throughout North America.

            <p>
                Since then I&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;discovered"by Ed McMahon, which led to an appearance with him in Las Vegas, a spot on the 15th
                Annual American Comedy Awards, and several appearances on the Jerry Lewis Telethon.
            </p>

            <p>
                Turns out I have a bit of an international appeal, and have headlined at &ldquo;The Singapore International Comedy Festival", made
                several appearances on the #1 French Variety TV Show, &ldquo;Le Plus Grand Cabaret Du Monde&rdquo;, and extensive touring throughout
                Canada, New Zealand &amp;Australia, as part of the&ldquo;World Festival of Magic"
            </p>
            <img alt="Image not available" id="img-06" src="steinberg/images/toddandedm.jpg" />
            <p>
                I perform on cruise ships internationally, in casinos (Las Vegas, Reno, Atlantic City, &amp; the Bahamas), corporate events,
                colleges/universities, conventions, resorts, fairs/festivals, and even amusement parks. Recently I appeared at Busch Gardens Theme
                Park in Tampa Bay, Florida &ndash;180 shows in 7 weeks!!! OUCH!!!
            </p>

            <p>
                Besides my appearances on the Jerry Lewis Telethon, other TV shows I&rsquo;ve performed on include &ldquo;The Statler Brothers
                Show"(TNN),&ldquo;Ed McMahon&rsquo;s Next Big Star"(NBC), &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Funniest People&rdquo;(ABC), &ldquo;Comedy

                I&rsquo;m writing &amp;creating new material everyday. My show keeps evolving, it&rsquo;s truly a work in progress. Even though
                I&rsquo;ve been doing this for awhile, I feel like I&rsquo;m just getting started!
