            <h3>
                Jimmy Is Born
            </h3>

            <p>
                Jimmy Keys was born in Gravesend, Kent, England. As a young child he studied classical piano. At the age of twelve Jimmy started
                playing in school bands. He soon graduated to the local music scene, working in clubs and pubs with numerous pop, soul and rock
                groups, singing and playing keyboards.

            <h3>
                Touring Europe
            </h3>

            <p>
                This continued until at age 20 he turned &ldquo;professional&rdquo; and went off to Germany with a local group, to seek fame and
                fortune following after dozens of other post&ndash;Beatle bands!
            </p>
            <img alt="Image not available" id="keys-body-img3" src="keys/images/inset-60s.jpg" />
            <p>
                Early 70&rsquo;s he went on to work and tour in Europe with many top soul artists from the States including Ben E. King, Eddie Floyd
                and Percy Sledge. Later, with his own band, he worked extensively throughout Europe and the Middle East. A highlight was when the
                band recorded at the famous Abbey Road Studios in London. The band was constantly touring in England, Holland, Spain, Scandinavia
                &amp; Germany. After several other groups Jimmy formed a trio and they were cruising from London to Spain and the Canary Islands for
                one year continuously!<br />
                <br />
                In 1981 he decided to return to his first love, the piano, and become a solo entertainer, with his first gig on the island of Ibiza,
                Spain. He worked the European piano bar circuit for a couple of years, before arriving on the beautiful island of Bermuda for a 1
                month contract that turned into 13 years!

            <p>
                This music and comedy show really evolved in Bermuda between the mid eighties to the year 2000 when Jimmy was very famous on the
                island. For 5 years he was the resident manic entertainer at the world famous "Henry VIII Pub&rdquo;, where he built a huge
                following. From &lsquo;94 to &lsquo;99 he became the main headliner at the Southampton Princess Hotel and was a firm favorite with
                locals, and tourists from all over the world.

                and worked in over a dozen countries entertaining thousands of people of many nationalities. He is definitely one of those unique

                Jimmy has developed a very unique and highly entertaining musical and comedy act. He&rsquo;s a cross between Elton John (in that he
                sings and plays the piano) and Robin Williams (in that his comedy is off&ndash;the&ndash;wall). His show is packed with comedy,
                visual musical impressions and favorite Broadway songs, wrapped around some of the most exciting piano playing and audience
                participation that you will ever witness.
