                    In the famous and beloved film, George Bailey, through divine intervention, discovers that he is living a wonderful life. Likewise,
                    in real life, magician John Calvert, now in his late nineties, has truly lived and continues to live an amazing life.
                </p>
                <h3>Career</h3>
                <p>
                    Born in 1911, Calvert still tours and performs his elaborate stage magic show that is reminiscent of the touring shows of the 1930's
                    at the height of Thurston and Blackstone Sr. In fact, Calvert&rsquo;s show is not just
                    reminiscent, he actually toured during that era. And magic is only a portion of this intriguing magician&rsquo;s rich and
                    wide-spanning career.
                </p>

                <p>
                    John Calvert has performed magic for an astounding 80 years, which includes Broadway and countries around the world. For a time, he
                    piloted his own planes, DC-9s none the less, that carried his props and crew and was an active yachtsman who survived some dangerous situations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With his dashing good looks and natural acting abilities, Calvert had roles in some 40 movies in the forties and fifties and worked
                    with famous stars such as Danny Kaye, Gary Cooper and more. Most notably, Calvert starred in three films as &ldquo;The Falcon&rdquo;, portraying a
                    detective.

                <h3>Biographical Documentary</h3>
                <div id="bio-doc">
                    <p>
                        A documentary, &ldquo;John Calvert: His Magic and Adventures,&rdquo; which is available on DVD, presents the magician&rsquo;s varied
                        and interesting life, as well as shows entertaining excerpts from his theatrical magic act.
                    </p>
                    <div id="body-review">
                        <p>
                            &ldquo;The film is well organized and offers interesting interviews with Calvert and his wife and assistant Tammy and more. I find it
                            particularly interesting to view footage of Calvert today, touring and setting up his show in theaters and working with crews.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Calvert&rsquo;s cumulative experiences are awe-inspiring and he&rsquo;s a fantastic and entertaining magician. If anything, the film
                            leaves you wanting more. For a look at this unique and fascinating magician, I highly recommend his documentary.&rdquo

                    <p>
                        John Calvert is touring the USA presenting lectures and shows for magician orginations and charaties.  
                        In addition he is making an in person appearances with &ldquo;The John Calvert Film Festival&rdquo;.

                    <p>
                        A program that is flexable to fit in any established film festival or for a fund raising special event. 
                        The program may be the showing of his Falcon series, in which he starred. Also available for screening 
                        is &ldquo;The Curse of the Elephants Grave&rdquo; which Mr. Calvert produced in Africa, wrote and played the lead. 
                        In the cast was John Caradine and Ann Cornell.  The movie had a major release, when it was originally 
                        titled &ldquo;Dark Venture&rdquo;. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The film, along with John Calvert&rsquo;s illustion show broke the attendance record at Loew's Theater on Broadway. 
                        Recently, the film was edited and additional footage was added. It is now  the only movie in history that 
                        the actors age in real time. It was the last screen appearance of David Carradine, who did a prolog for the 
                        current version of the movie.
