                Rio Clemente Master Jazz Pianist
            </p>

            <p>
                Anyone who has listened to Rio Clemente play piano, comes away in awe!
            </p>

            <p>
                NEW YORK CITY &ndash; Manhattan&rsquo;s famed Birdland. The Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel. The West Bank Caf&eacute;&rsquo;s Laurie
                Beechman Theater. The New York Friars Club. The Sylvia &amp; Danny Kaye Theatre at Hunter College. The Player&rsquo;s Club. Carnegie
                Hall and Lincoln Center.
            </p>

            <p>
                This master pianist mixes a strong classical background with a rich knowledge of jazz history, then adds an amazing sense of
                creativity and interpretation. The result is music that is different from others, and nearly always produces a standing ovation and
                cries for &ldquo;more&rdquo;. When reviewers stumble for words to describe his work, it&rsquo;s because words fail to convey the rich
                depth of character, nimble facility of play and ease with which his music is crafted and performed. The man brings some thing very
                special and decidedly unequaled to the piano.
            </p>

            <p>
                Rio&rsquo;s career began with a BMI scholarship for musical theatre and subsequent studies at Julliard School of Music. A grant from
                Broadway Tomorrow for new composers followed. Along with his classical training, Rio developed a style embracing a diversity of music
                that makes him one of the most expressive and versatile pianists anywhere.
            </p>

            <p>
                After several television appearances, Rio advanced professionally to playing at the JVC JazzFestival, Newport Jazz Festival, Carnegie
                Hall and Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center. He has entertained audiences in Europe, Bermuda, the Virgin Islands and Antigua. He has
                performed at theUnited Nations and has appeared with the Jefferson Symphony in Golden, CO, with the Livingston NJ Symphony and with
                ensemble groups like the Morris Choral Society and Orchestra. He has performed from coast to coast for senators, governors, mayors
                and other dignitaries. He has played jazz clubs from Manhattan to Cape Cod and from Florida to California.
            </p>

            <p>
                He has recorded under contract for Melody Music, Satellite Records, Riff Records and Holland labels, and published eight CDs under
                his own Etnemelc Music Productions label. As a composer, he has written a number of selections ranging from gospel to Latin,
                including orchestral arrangements. In collaboration with lyricist/author, Carmine Lombardo, Rio has composed the music for three
                musicals including the family musical, &ldquo;Dobdinob&rdquo;. As a music educator, he has served as music director for the
                Generations of Jazz program of the New Jersey Jazz Society, and presents customized programs in schools, including Viva La Musica
                Latina with percussionist Russ Moy.

            <p>
                Rio has recorded with bassist Milt Hinton, performed Dave Brubeck&rsquo;s mass (To Hope! A Celebration) and prepared a feature CD on
                Richard Rodgers that led Linda Rodgers to say, &ldquo;Rio plays my father&rsquo;s music better than anyone I ever heard ? with
                unremitting style and sensitivity, and always with a technique that is elegant.&rdquo; Dave Brubeck has written, &ldquo;Rio Clemente
                is EXCELLENT!&rdquo;
            </p>

            <p>
                A native of Morristown, NJ, Rio is a member of its Hall of Fame. He?s been named &ldquo;Professional Artist of the Year&rdquo; by the
                Arts Council of the Morris Area, New Jersey Monthly Magazine named himamong its &ldquo;Top 40 New Jerseyans&rdquo; and the New Jersey
                Jazz Society named him &ldquo;Musician of the Year&rdquo;.
