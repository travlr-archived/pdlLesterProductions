                    Martin Preston is an actor and musician who has devoted the past 20 years to re&ndash;creating the music and glamour of the late,
                    great Liberace. A native of Indianapolis, Martin was bitten by the show business bug at the age of six, when he began classical
                    piano training. While growing up, he discovered a flair not only for music, but also for acting, comedy, and wearing unusual
                    costumes! After graduating with honors from Oakland City University, Martin began his performing career in earnest, appearing on
                    stages throughout the United States and Canada both as an actor and a concert pianist.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Always a Liberace fan, his piano style was frequently compared to that of the flamboyant showman (yes, all of the show's piano
                    playing is LIVE), and in 1988, work began on a tribute to the great entertainer. What was to have been a twenty minute act
                    quickly grew into a two-hour extravaganza that has generated critical and popular acclaim throughout the world!
                </p>

                <p>
                    He debuted as Liberace at Jan McArt's Royal Palm Theatre in Boca Raton, Florida in 1990, running for a record-breaking 32 weeks.
                    Since then, Martin has appeared as Liberace in Las Vegas and Atlantic city, in many of the North America's finest theatres and
                    showrooms, and throughout the world on the Cunard, Holland America, and Princess Cruise Lines. In addition to performing at
                    several gala celebrations at the famed Liberace Museum in Las Vegas, Preston is an honored recipient of the Grand Prize in the
                    Liberace Piano Competition.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Recently, Mr. Preston was invited to star in the symphonic production Pops Goes Vegas! His performances as Liberace with the
                    Indianapolis Symphony, Baltimore Symphony, National Arts Centre Orchestra in Ottawa, Canada, Detroit Symphony, San Diego
                    Symphony, Phoenix Symphony, and many others, are bringing the magic of Liberace to a whole new audience! But no matter where he
                    is appearing, his greatest thrill is meeting the great showman's many fans, and being told "You ARE Liberace!"
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Liberace Foundation supports and applauds Martin's performance and tribute to Liberace.
