                    Performing Around the World
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Alan&rsquo;s international credits include a three month theater tour in the Republic of South Africa in 1992; a July 4th
                    performance in Beijing, China in 1997 for the U.S. Ambassador to China and 5,000 Americans; Malaysia in 1997; the United Arab
                    Emirates (UAE), Dubai in 2000; and dozens of trips north to Canada where he performs regularly. Alan&rsquo;s credits in North
                    America include over 300 Fortune 500 companies, and ten of the top 100 fairs and exhibitions in the United States and Canada. His
                    casino credits including seven weeks at the Tropicana in Atlantic City, the El Dorado in Reno, and Bally&rsquo;s Grand Hotel in
                    Las Vegas. Alan also entertains at many colleges and universities, and has performed for many corporate trade show clients.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Make &lsquo;em Laugh, Make &lsquo;em Laugh!
                </h3>

                <p>
                    While his favorite entertainment medium is hypnosis, the underlying theme of his performances is always comedy. Alan makes people
                    laugh! His unique sense of humor is often described as a combination of &ldquo;funny ha ha&rdquo; and &ldquo;funny
                    strange&rdquo;. Sands says his sense of humor&ndash;sometimes dry, often corny, but always funny&ndash;has been influenced by a
                    combination of street performing in San Francisco and his youth growing up in the Catskills. It consists of
                    double&ndash;entendres and one&ndash;liners that often touch on the political. &ldquo;I don't say anything that would offend my
                    mom&rdquo;, he assures. Of course, his mother did dance with the Follies Bergiere!
                </p>

                <h3>
                    A Unique Stage Hypnosis Exhibition
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Also known as The Sandman, comedy hypnotist Alan Sands brings his volunteers&rsquo; subconscious minds to the movies, through
                    extreme temperature changes, and to Mars. Under Alan&rsquo;s spell, subjects have bizarre animal encounters, arguments in
                    international tongues, and collectively create what Alan likes to call &ldquo;a three&ndash;ring circus of dreams&rdquo; where
                    everyone on stage imagines different fantasies all at the same time! One of Alan&rsquo;s great talents is that he can entertain
                    all ages, from children to adults, and he makes them laugh simultaneously, keep them laughing and to leave them wanting more. His
                    60&ndash;90 minute comedy hypnosis show is best described as &ldquo;a situation comedy using audience participation&rdquo;.
