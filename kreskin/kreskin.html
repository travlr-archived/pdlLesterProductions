                The Amazing Kreskin
            </h1>

            <p>
                With a showman&rsquo;s flair, a comedian&rsquo;s wit, and the capacities of a bona fide Mentalist or thought reader, The Amazing
                Kreskin has, for some six decades, dramatized the unique facets of the human mind?his own. His very name has become an integral part
                of pop culture throughout the world, invoked in comedy clubs, comic strips, print stories, and TV shows from sitcoms on through
                national magazines.
            </p>

            <p>
                Born in Montclair, New Jersey, it was during the childhood game &ldquo;hot and cold&rdquo; that Kreskin&rsquo;s remarkable ability to
                find hidden objects emerged. His ability to read thoughts expanded, and by his teens he also became nationally recognized in the
                United States as &ldquo;The World&rsquo;s Youngest Hypnotist&rdquo;, resulting in his collaborating in psychological clinical studies
                extending into the realm of Parapsychology and the Power of Suggestion. By his late teens, this icon of thought transference
                developed a mental test that has become the highlight of his performances all over the world. This signature piece has Kreskin
                requesting that his check be hidden somewhere within the venue he is appearing. If he fails to find it, he will forfeit his fee.
            </p>

            <p>
                Through the decades, audiences of all ages have been drawn to this legendary figure. How many other celebrities can boast their own
                television series, their own board game, over some sixteen books, their own theme song arranged by the renowned Skitch Henderson at
                Carnegie Hall, let alone hundreds of appearances on almost every talk/variety show to be had. His performances have been seen all
                over the world, and he has flown over 3 million miles.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Amazing Kreskin has also become a training consultant to law enforcement and security personnel throughout the western world in
                the development in their own powers of observation and intuitive skills. Kreskin continues to offer &ldquo;$50,000 to anybody that
                can prove that he employs paid secret assistants or confederates in any phase of his program&rdquo;. It is an offer that he has held
                for many, many years.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, through the years, Kreskin has received international recognition for extraordinary predictions often dealing with world
                affairs. Regarding the US Presidential Election in 2008, he logged the results with a written statement made 11 months earlier, on
                December 6, 2007. In the year 2008 on FOX Business News, he predicted the results of the Super Bowl three days before the game.
            </p>

            <p>
                A few years earlier in Canada, one month before a national election, he predicted the re&ndash;election of Prime Minister Martin, and
                named the exact amount of seats he would carry. On the day after the election, on National Canadian Television, he reflected that the
                government could collapse in 14 months. He was off by 5 days. He has been called by many the Nostradamus of the twentieth century.
            </p>

            <p>
                2009 HOLDS DRAMATIC PRECEDENCE IN KRESKIN?S CAREER Beginning in Canada, Bravo will initiate a new television series called Star
                Portraits, in which the entire program will be devoted to a high profile celebrity who has agreed to allow a trio of outstanding
                Canadian artists to each do a portrait of a celebrity which, when the celebrity is brought back weeks later, will climax the show.
                The decision was made that to launch the series would be The Amazing Kreskin.
            </p>

            <p>
                Actor/Producer Tom Hanks announced March 20, 2009 to be the debut of a feature film, The Great Buck Howard, starring Tom Hanks and
                John Malkovich. It is announced at the end of the movie that the inspiration for the key character of the screenplay is The Amazing
                Kreskin, the character played by John Malkovich.
